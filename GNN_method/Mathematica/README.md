# Interactive Proof of Theorem 3.1

**Theorem 3.1:** Given a finite discretisation of $\lambda$, an infinite family of MILP instances together with an infinite amount of family-wide valid cuts can be constructed. Using a pure cutting plane approach and applying a single cut per selection round, the infinite family of instances do not solve to optimality for any value in the discretisation, but do solve to optimality for an infinite amount of alternative $\lambda$ values.

An interactive proof of Theorem 3.1 is provided in `cut-selector-3d.nb`. Open it in Mathematica and play around as
you wish. The cells are ordered and above each cell is the Lemma the cell proves and an explanation
on why it is sufficient.
